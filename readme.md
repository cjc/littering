#Littering - a less elegant javascript span injector

Littering is an [ender](https://github.com/ender-js/ender) compatible variation of [lettering.js](https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js). Where lettering.js injects positional classes for styling chars/words/lins, Littering accepts functions to determine which classes to apply to which elements.
