#Littering - a less elegant javascript span injector

Littering is an [ender](https://github.com/ender-js/ender) compatible variation of [Lettering.js](https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js). Where lettering.js injects positional classes for styling chars/words/lins, Littering accepts functions to determine which classes to apply to which elements.

Status - Initial version replicating partial Lettering.js functionality with ender.

##Credits

Inspiration and some code (examples/index.html, the injector func) pinched from the excellent [Lettering.js](https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js).
